# Teamo_Android


Android application developing project for 2021-2 OOP class project 4 

Developed by Team #8

This project is for the Project #4 in 2021-2 OOP class developed by Team #8. We have developed an Android-based application ‘Teamo’. The name of the app is derived from the word ‘team’ and ‘모으다’, which is a Korean word meaning to assemble or organize. Our development process of this service is separated into 2 parts, one with client app on AOS and the server one. The client part is developed on Android Studio IDE using JAVA language, as well as the server is developed with TypeScript language and NestJS platform. As you can simply imagine from the name, this application is for helping students organize the team when doing their team project. Based on the course they take, a user can create own team with members taking the same course. Or it is also able to join in the existing team which other fellows have already created. Because of short developing period, the app now serves to the students in SW department of CAU only. We’d like to make lots of other students use our service in the near future.
